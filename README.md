# 2023 Definitive Map for Central Bedfordshire Council

This repository contains data and the license file returned to me by Central Bedfordshire Council in response to a request under the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 for data on Public Ways. I specifically asked for information on the [Defintive Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitive_map), Definitive Statements (written descriptions of the rights of way) and an [Open Government License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Government_Licence) to allow for the re-use of the data.

## Why did I do this?

[Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) is a community based geospatial database project that collects information on areas known to the mappers. It is used by thousands of applications, websites and has a high use to geospatial researchers.

Unlike other commercial alternatives it is also free and open.

I'd noticed some rights of way which were not accurately reflected on the map. Central Beds data and licencing was also [missing on a page tracking rights of way progress](https://osm.mathmos.net/prow/open-data/) by a member of the Open Street Map community.

My aim is to take this data and use it to gradually update the map of rights of way for Central Bedfordshire.

## Where did I obtain the data

The data was provided on the 10th October 2023 by Central Bedfordshire Council in response to an [Environmental Information Regulations 2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Information_Regulations_2004) request placed by me.

Files provided show the correspondance returned from the council as well as the license provided.

## How can this data be used?

Central Bedfordshire council has licensed this data for re-use under the Open Government License. I have provided the PDF amongst the files.

The license allows for a broad and permissive re-use, see the license document for specific details.
